name: qta-development-orchestration
description: Use as the parent-only controller for a bounded QTA development lifecycle spanning contract, fixed roles, candidate commits, review, verification, and finalization. It coordinates work but never replaces specialist roles.
when_to_use: Use for autonomous, standard, cross-repository, long-running, high-risk, or explicitly end-to-end QTA delivery. Do not invoke inside a child agent, for a read-only question, or for a trivial edit that needs no multi-role lifecycle.

# QTA Development Orchestration

## Purpose

Run a deterministic development lifecycle from the parent context without replaying full history, allowing
child roles to redefine completion, or accepting a candidate that differs from the reviewed revision.

This Skill is a controller. It does not implement, review, or verify work itself.

## Trigger Conditions

Invoke when:

- The user requests end-to-end, autonomous, goal-mode, overnight, or multi-stage delivery.
- A standard or high-risk task needs fixed role separation.
- Prior attempts looped without a stable candidate or evidence-backed verdict.
- Backend and frontend, database, provider, scheduler, security, deployment, or financial semantics interact.

Do not invoke from a child Agent or merely because the user mentioned experts, agents, or teams.

## Lane Selection

Select exactly one risk lane before creating a role. Lane reflects blast radius, not expected duration:

| Lane | Use when | Maximum ACs | Required roles and gates |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `L0` | Documentation or a mechanical low-risk edit | 3 | implementer + clean verifier; static gate |
| `L1` | Bounded single-module behavior without migration | 5 | all four roles; focused and full tests |
| `L2` | Migration, transaction, compatibility, concurrency, provider, scheduler, or performance | 8 | all four roles; package and independent verifier |
| `L3` | Funds, authorization, cross-repository contract, irreversible data/runtime, or deployment-critical change | 10 | all four roles; required runtime and deployment evidence |

Record any omitted role and why. A task cannot be downgraded after a failed gate merely to obtain a pass.
Read `references/GOVERNANCE_V2_POLICY.md` only when selecting a lane, dispatching a repair, enforcing a budget,
or deciding an architecture gate. Do not copy that reference into every TaskPacket.

## Parent State Machine

Run these states in order:

```text
CONTEXT_READY
  -> CONTRACT_DRAFTED
  -> TEST_DESIGN_READY
  -> CONTRACT_FROZEN
  -> IMPLEMENTING
  -> SELF_CHECKED
  -> CANDIDATE_FROZEN
  -> REVIEW_CLEAR
  -> VERIFIED
  -> FINALIZED
  -> DELIVERY_READY
```

Allowed backward transitions:

- `REVIEW_CLEAR` failure -> `IMPLEMENTING` with a numbered finding set.
- `VERIFIED` failure -> `IMPLEMENTING` with verifier findings.
- Any state -> `BLOCKED` when the same failure fingerprint repeats twice without new evidence.
- `L0` may omit test design/review through an explicit omission record and transition directly from
  `CANDIDATE_FROZEN` to clean `VERIFIED`.

`L0` never omits its bounded implementer or clean final verifier. A closeout resumes the original task and
its role history. When recovering a legacy task that has an implementation slice but no valid implementer
evidence, dispatch an evidence-only implementer before freezing the candidate; parent-authored gates do not
substitute for that role run.

Never run code review and final verification in parallel. Never finalize before verification. `VERIFIED`
requires both `FUNCTIONAL=PASS` and `ARCHITECTURE=PASS` for the same candidate identity.

The parent continues until one terminal state: `DELIVERY_READY`, `BLOCKED`, or an explicit user stop.
`FINALIZED` means finalization records exist; it is not permission to end Goal mode. A plan, one role artifact,
one repair, or self-reported acceptance is not completion. Do not start a second product task merely to keep
an overnight run busy.

If the original parent session becomes unavailable while its control remains non-terminal, a replacement
session must use `/qta-run --resume <TASK-ID> <objective-or-control-path>`. The Hook transfers only a matching
same-project active lock whose control identity is valid and non-terminal; it never silently steals another
task or asks the user to delete audit files.

## Autonomous Decision Policy

`/qta-run` is an unattended lifecycle. Inside the frozen contract, choose the recommended reversible
implementation option without asking the user and record the decision and evidence in the control file.
Never invoke `AskUserQuestion` in an active governed run. If product/financial meaning is unresolved, a
destructive or credential-bearing action requires authorization, or external state makes every safe path
impossible, persist an evidence-backed `BLOCKED` checkpoint and stop; do not leave the task waiting for a
human response. The workspace Hook enforces this policy for the active parent session.

## Task Packet

Every fixed-role Agent/Task prompt must begin with these exact two standalone lines:

```text
# Task Packet: <TASK-ID> / <ROLE> / <ROLE-RUN-ID>
- Dispatch ID: <DISPATCH-ID>
```

`<ROLE>` is one of `TEST_DESIGNER`, `IMPLEMENTER`, `CODE_REVIEWER`, or `FINAL_VERIFIER`. Copy this prefix
from `assets/TASK_PACKET_TEMPLATE.md`; do not paraphrase it or bury the dispatch ID in prose. If the Hook
rejects the prefix, correct the same TaskPacket and retry that dispatch once. Never invoke
`scripts/zcode-governance-hook.mjs` manually or create a synthetic packet to manufacture a receipt.

Give every role only:

- `task_id`, `lane`, `role_run_id`, and assigned AC IDs.
- Contract path and `contract_hash`.
- Authority paths, not copied document contents.
- Baseline commit, branch, pre-existing dirty-path manifest, and allowed write paths.
- Candidate identity: immutable commit/tree/patch hashes, or snapshot manifest path/hashes when Git writes
  are not authorized.
- Frozen baseline-to-candidate diff artifact path/hash so read-only reviewers never need Bash or inherited
  parent output.
- Previous finding IDs and `repair_round` when repairing.
- Required output artifact and stop conditions.
- Runtime enforcement level: currently `ADVISORY`, plus the compensating hash/worktree check and optional
  Hook-observed session receipt.

Do not pass the complete parent conversation or unrelated repository history.
Create or update the schema-v3 machine control file from `assets/TASK_CONTROL_TEMPLATE.json`. Freeze bounded
implementation slices and a stable test inventory before implementation. Run
`node scripts/check-ai-task-control.mjs <control-file>` before each role dispatch and lifecycle transition.
This gate validates the JSON schema, actual contract/candidate/artifact hashes, transition and repair history,
role generations, ZCode runtime session receipts, hash-chained control anchors, SNAPSHOT changed-path coverage,
AC evidence, quality verdicts, and finalization identity. A prose status cannot override it.

## Role Dispatch

1. Parent drafts the contract with `$qta-task-contract`.
2. A fresh `qta-test-designer` instance challenges the draft and returns an artifact payload.
3. Parent persists accepted amendments and freezes `contract_hash`.
4. Dispatch one fresh `qta-implementer` per frozen slice. One slice has at most three ACs, eight expected
   files, and 500 production-line additions. The parent assembles slices but never edits implementation.
5. Parent freezes candidate identity:
   - `COMMIT`: create the candidate commit and record commit/tree/patch hashes.
   - `SNAPSHOT`: create a deterministic allowlisted candidate manifest and record manifest/entry-set hashes.
   - In both modes, persist an exact frozen diff artifact and its SHA-256 for read-only review.
6. A fresh `qta-code-reviewer` instance reviews exactly that frozen candidate on functional and architecture
   tracks.
7. Parent sends one consolidated finding set to a new implementer instance for each repair round; any new
   candidate invalidates prior review.
8. Every candidate generation receives a new reviewer instance. Never reuse the prior reviewer conversation.
9. After `REVIEW_CLEAR`, a fresh `qta-final-verifier` verifies the same candidate in a disposable worktree.
10. Parent persists the verdict. Only permitted acceptance routes to `$qta-delivery-finalization`.
11. Parent creates a distinct finalization artifact, tracks all task evidence when authorized, sets
    `DELIVERY_READY`, and runs `node scripts/check-ai-delivery-ready.mjs <control-file>`.

Read-only roles return structured artifact payloads. The parent writes those payloads to task-local files.
A fixed role is an immutable template, not a persistent Agent. Every role run has a unique `role_run_id` and
session identifier, receives no inherited child history, and is destroyed after returning its artifact. The
parent is never a fallback implementer, reviewer, or verifier. Parent substitution is a `POLICY_VIOLATION`
and cannot be accepted. A role run that compacts, invokes a prohibited tool, or reuses a prior session is also
`POLICY_VIOLATION`; discard its artifact and rerun once in a fresh instance.

Record every dispatched attempt after it terminates, including `TIMED_OUT`, `PLAN_ONLY`, `FAILED`,
`CANCELLED`, and `POLICY_VIOLATION`. Do not omit failed attempts from `roleRuns`. Two timeouts for the same
slice require `BLOCKED` and a new bounded contract/reslice; never launch another whole-task implementer.

The workspace Hook may create a session first-seen receipt under `.git/qta-governance/sessions/`; record its
path and the role start/finish timestamps. The control gate rejects a reused, wrong-project, or out-of-window
receipt. Every successful control validation appends a hash-chained anchor under
`.git/qta-governance/tasks/`; direct role access to that store is prohibited. These same-user local controls
are tamper-evident workflow guards, not platform-authenticated security evidence, so current runs must remain
`ADVISORY` plus compensating isolation.
For every fixed `qta-*` Agent/Task dispatch, the Hook also requires the TaskPacket header plus unique dispatch
ID and creates an exclusive receipt under `.git/qta-governance/dispatches/`. Delivery readiness reconciles
those receipts bidirectionally with terminal `roleRuns`, exposing omitted failed attempts.
Append a role-run row only after that role reaches a terminal status. Accepted rows require
`executorType=SUBAGENT`, the exact `.zcode/agents/` definition, matching capability, and
`executionOutcome=COMPLETED`. Anchored role rows are immutable events, not mutable RUNNING records.

Implementation and final-verification profiles use ZCode `bypassPermissions` so their bounded Bash gates can
run unattended. Their explicit tool allowlists, disallowed tools, TaskPacket paths, Hook policy, candidate
hashes, and role boundaries remain authoritative; bypass mode is not permission to expand scope. Implementers
use dedicated read/search tools for inspection and must not burn the role window on repeated shell-filtered
test reruns.

Codex sandbox profiles may expose `.git` as read-only. In that case, request scoped permission only for
`node scripts/check-ai-task-control.mjs`; never disable the anchor. The validator returns this recovery
instruction on `EPERM/EACCES` instead of a raw stack trace.

Do not claim `ENFORCED` until the client exposes a platform-authenticated role/session attestation that the
validator can verify independently. Arbitrary Bash running as the same OS user can invoke or rewrite local
scripts; local Hook/receipt/anchor evidence cannot prove resistance to a malicious same-user agent.

## Git And Push Policy

The parent is the sole Git owner. Child roles must not stage, commit, rebase, merge, or push.

Before any Git write, read the frozen contract's `git_automation` value:

- `NONE`: prepare paths and commit messages only.
- `COMMIT`: create approved stage commits locally.
- `COMMIT_AND_CHECKPOINT_PUSH`: also push complete stage commits to the task branch.
- `DELIVERY_PUSH`: also push the accepted finalization revision to its approved target.

The value must come from explicit user authorization recorded by the parent. Missing authorization means
`NONE`; never infer permission from an autonomous-development request alone.

Preflight the selected Git mode before implementation. If the runtime cannot obtain the required scoped
approval, freeze `NONE + SNAPSHOT` at contract time. Do not discover a missing commit/push permission during
finalization.

When the value is `NONE`, use `SNAPSHOT` candidate mode. Run
`scripts/create-candidate-manifest.mjs` over the exact candidate path allowlist, store the generated manifest
beside task state, and pass its manifest and entry-set SHA-256 to reviewer and verifier. Regenerate and compare
the manifest before and after each gate; any mismatch invalidates earlier evidence.

For every candidate mode, the parent persists a baseline-to-candidate diff artifact under the task directory.
In `COMMIT` mode its SHA-256 must equal `patchSha256`; in `SNAPSHOT` mode the control gate validates the diff
artifact hash and every current manifest entry. Reviewer input must reference this artifact instead of asking
the read-only role to execute Git.
The SNAPSHOT manifest must cover every repository path changed from `baselineCommit`, except the frozen
pre-existing dirty-path list and explicitly identified task-control/evidence metadata. An omitted changed path
invalidates the candidate.

Create or switch to the frozen dedicated task branch before the first file write. Governed sessions may not
edit, stage, commit, merge, cherry-pick, revert, or tag on `main`/`master`. Use a dedicated task branch for
`L1`, `L2`, and `L3` work, and normally for `L0` recovery/closeout work. Create traceable commits at these gates:

1. `contract`: contract and test design frozen.
2. `candidate`: implementation is `SELF_CHECKED`.
3. `repair-N`: one commit per accepted finding set.
4. `finalization`: independently accepted documentation and delivery records.

Before every commit:

- Confirm changed paths are inside the task packet.
- Exclude pre-existing dirty and secret-bearing files.
- Run the stage's required checks.
- Prepare the task-state fields that are knowable before the commit.

After a stage commit:

1. Compute its immutable commit/tree/patch identity.
2. Update task state with that identity.
3. If checkpoint persistence is authorized, create a separate metadata-only `checkpoint` commit containing
   task state and role artifacts, then push both commits to the task branch.

The checkpoint commit is orchestration metadata, not a new candidate. Reviewer and verifier continue to target
the recorded candidate commit/tree or snapshot manifest, not task-branch `HEAD`.

A checkpoint push may push the task branch after a complete stage commit when remote access is available.
It is backup only and must not be described as deployable. A delivery push is allowed only after the accepted
candidate remains unchanged, finalization completes, and the delivery-ready gate passes. Contract, control,
diff, role, review, verification, architecture, test-receipt, and finalization artifacts must all be tracked.
Never automatically push directly to the protected/default branch, force-push, or hide a push failure.

## Repair And Stop Rules

- Persist `repair_round`, finding IDs, and a normalized failure fingerprint in task state.
- Run at most two repair rounds for the same failure fingerprint.
- A changed contract requires a new contract version and invalidates candidate/review/verdict evidence.
- A changed candidate invalidates review and verification evidence.
- Missing credentials or runtime access is `BLOCKED` or `NOT_VERIFIED`, never a simulated pass.
- Production-code repairs receive finding-specific tests and an affected-diff review. Pure test/evidence
  repairs receive incremental review unless identity or behavior changed.
- Run focused tests during implementation and repair. Run the full suite/package once before freezing the
  final candidate and once independently in verification; do not repeat an unchanged full gate.
- The frozen test inventory is immutable with the contract. The final verifier executes every required test
  through `scripts/run-ai-evidence-command.mjs`; a missing selector, nonzero exit, changed candidate, absent
  receipt, or receipt from another role/session is not verified.
- At 25% context, persist discoveries. At 40%, do not open a new stage; checkpoint. At 60%, terminate the
  role and continue in a fresh context. The first compaction forces handoff; a second is prohibited.
- Record `contextMeasurement=UNAVAILABLE` and `contextPercent=null` when the runtime exposes no reliable
  telemetry. Do not invent a percentage; enforce turn, wait, poll, repair, and compaction limits instead.
- Use one long wait for a role and at most one follow-up wait. A long-running shell command may be polled at
  most three times with increasing waits. Status-only wakeups and repeated unchanged commands are prohibited.
- When usage telemetry is available, stop at the lane budget or 5% of the weekly allowance. Otherwise enforce
  the role-turn, wait, poll, repair, and context limits recorded in the control file.

## Architecture Gate

Before `REVIEW_CLEAR`, run `node scripts/check-ai-architecture.mjs --base <baseline>
--architecture-review-count <count> --candidate-identity <candidate> --json-output <report>` in COMMIT mode,
or add `--manifest <candidate-manifest>` in SNAPSHOT mode. Bind the report hash to review and verification.
Every warning requires a structured disposition by report ID. Any machine `errors > 0`, nonzero exit, report
hash mismatch, or candidate mismatch blocks the candidate; reviewer prose cannot waive it. Fixing an invalid
detector is a separate governed change, never an inline reinterpretation.

## Goal Completion Gate

Goal mode may report success only after the control file is `DELIVERY_READY` and
`node scripts/check-ai-delivery-ready.mjs <control-file>` exits `0` on a tracked, clean delivery revision.
The gate rejects parent-authored specialist artifacts, plan-only verification, missing test receipts,
architecture errors, reused verification/finalization artifacts, untracked evidence, candidate drift, branch
mismatch, and unapproved dirty paths. If it fails, transition to `BLOCKED` or a governed repair; never ask the
model-only Goal completion judge to reinterpret the failure.

`/qta-run` activates a parent-session Stop Hook. ZCode may request continuation at most three times, so this is
not a retry budget: move deterministically to the next lifecycle state, or persist an evidence-backed
`BLOCKED` state when the frozen repair/timeout limit is reached. The Hook releases only `BLOCKED` or a passing
`DELIVERY_READY` task.

Generate event timestamps from the runtime clock. Transition and role timestamps must be monotonic, inside
the task window, and not in the future; do not invent convenient ISO values.

## Required Output

Return the current state, lane, contract hash, candidate mode/identity, role artifacts, exact evidence,
commit/push status, unverified dimensions, blockers, and next state. Do not summarize an incomplete lifecycle
as delivered.
