# Task Packet: <TASK-ID> / <ROLE> / <ROLE-RUN-ID>
- Dispatch ID: <DISPATCH-ID>

## Identity

- Lane:
- Lifecycle state:
- Role instance policy: `FRESH_ONLY`
- Executor type: `SUBAGENT` (parent substitution is a policy violation)
- Agent definition:
- Expected dispatch receipt path: `.git/qta-governance/dispatches/<task-hash>/<dispatch-hash>.json`
- Role session ID:
- Role started-at timestamp:
- Runtime session receipt path:
- Repair round:
- Assigned AC IDs:
- Assigned implementation slice ID:
- Contract path:
- Contract hash:
- Baseline commit:
- Candidate mode: `COMMIT | SNAPSHOT`
- Candidate commit:
- Candidate tree hash:
- Patch SHA-256:
- Frozen diff artifact path:
- Frozen diff artifact SHA-256:
- Candidate manifest path:
- Candidate manifest SHA-256:
- Candidate entry-set SHA-256:
- Machine control file:
- Append-only control anchor: `.git/qta-governance/tasks/<task-hash>.jsonl`

## Scope

- Repository:
- Allowed read paths:
- Allowed write paths:
- Pre-existing dirty paths:
- Prohibited actions:
- Interaction policy: `UNATTENDED` (`AskUserQuestion` prohibited; genuine input dependency -> `BLOCKED`)
- Runtime tool enforcement: `ADVISORY` (local Hook/receipt/anchor are not a same-user security boundary)
- Compensating isolation check:

For an implementer packet, assign exactly one frozen slice with at most three ACs, eight expected files, and
500 production-line additions. A timeout/plan-only/failure/cancellation still returns a terminal dispatch
record. Two timeouts for the same slice require `BLOCKED`; the parent must not implement it.

Implementer and final-verifier profiles run with `bypassPermissions` for unattended Bash. This never expands
the packet's write paths, tools, candidate scope, Git policy, or prohibited actions.

## Authority

- Product/design paths:
- API/data paths:
- Architecture paths:

## Inputs

- Previous role artifact:
- Finding IDs:
- Required fixtures/environment:

## Required Gates

| Gate | Command or inspection | Expected result | Evidence destination |
|---|---|---|---|

Every frozen test gate has a stable `test_id`, source path, exact selector, and receipt path. The final
verifier runs it through `scripts/run-ai-evidence-command.mjs`; generic prose is not evidence.

## Run Budget

- Maximum role turns:
- Maximum Agent waits: 2
- Maximum shell polls per command: 3
- Checkpoint at context: 40%
- Mandatory fresh-context handoff at: 60% or first compaction
- Raw-token/weekly budget when telemetry is available:

## Output Contract

- Required artifact type/path:
- Required status vocabulary:
- Required execution outcome: `COMPLETED | TIMED_OUT | PLAN_ONLY | FAILED | CANCELLED | POLICY_VIOLATION`
- Stop conditions:
