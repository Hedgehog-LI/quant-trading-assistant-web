# Progressive Disclosure Protocol

> Goal: keep AI sessions small, restartable, and auditable. Every Claude / ZCode / Codex session in this
> frontend repository should load only the context needed for the current task, then write a compact handoff
> before stopping.

## 1. Core Rule

Do not load the whole repository or the whole `docs/` tree.

Use this sequence:

1. Read the global entry files.
2. Identify the task type and affected modules.
3. Read only the routed documents for that task.
4. Inspect only changed or directly related code.
5. Work in a narrow scope.
6. Checkpoint before the context budget is exhausted.
7. Verify in a clean context, then finalize durable documents.

## 2. Session Start Checklist

Always start with:

```text
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md
docs/AI_HANDOFF.md
git status --short
```

Then answer these before reading more:

- What is the current task?
- Which repo is affected: this frontend repo, the backend, or both?
- Which feature/module is affected?
- Is this design, implementation, testing, deployment, or documentation?
- What files are already modified?

Read this protocol itself at startup only for long-running, resumed, or context-risk tasks. For a small fresh
task, the five-item list above is the complete Level 1 baseline.

## 3. Task Context Manifest

Before editing, produce a short manifest in the chat or task notes:

```text
Task:
Affected repo:
Affected module:
Must read:
May read if needed:
Must not read:
Planned edits:
Verification:
Handoff target:
```

Keep "must read" to the smallest possible set. If more context becomes necessary, add one document at a time and
state why.

## 4. Routing Rules

Use `docs/AI_DEVELOPMENT_INDEX.md §4` as the routing table.

Examples (frontend repository):

- Page / interaction bug: read affected `src/pages/<page>.tsx` + `src/features/<name>/` + `src/shared/api/*`.
- localStorage / mock behavior: read `src/shared/api/localStorageClient.ts` + its tests.
- Remote API integration: read `src/shared/api/client.ts` + `unwrappers.ts`; cross-repo API contract in the
  backend control repository.
- Testing/acceptance: read `docs/BUILD_CHECKLIST.md`, latest acceptance log, changed files, and only the docs
  that define expected behavior.

Avoid historical prompts and old handoff files unless debugging history.

## 5. Context Budget Guardrails

Use these limits unless the user explicitly asks for broader research:

- Prefer reading file sections over whole large files.
- Prefer Grep summaries before opening files.
- Do not open generated outputs, build artifacts, `dist/`, large logs, or long JSONL session logs unless
  investigating those exact artifacts.
- Do not run the full frontend gate for a documentation-only change.
- For one failure fingerprint, do at most two numbered repair rounds. If the second round still fails without
  new evidence, stop and write the blocker.

Default lifecycle thresholds:

- At 25% context use, freeze discoveries into the task contract or state file.
- At 40%, checkpoint before opening a new workstream.
- At 60%, stop implementation and continue from a clean context.
- At the first automatic compaction, checkpoint immediately and terminate the role instance.
- Never reuse an implementer for repair or a reviewer for another candidate generation.
- Never deliberately fill a 100% context window and rely on emergency compaction.

Control-loop limits:

- Wait for an Agent once with a long timeout; at most one follow-up wait is allowed for that role run.
- Give a long shell command an initial 30-second yield, then poll at most three times with increasing waits.
- Do not wake the model to report unchanged status.
- Do not rerun the same command against the same candidate/evidence hash.

## 6. Skill And Role Routing

Use one lifecycle stage at a time:

1. `qta-context-bootstrap`: read-only context router.
2. `qta-development-orchestration`: parent-only controller for multi-role delivery.
3. `qta-product-design`: product behavior and scope.
4. `qta-task-contract`: frozen AC and evidence plan.
5. `qta-backend-implementation` / `qta-frontend-implementation`: implementation and self-check.
6. `qta-task-checkpoint`: resumable task state.
7. `qta-independent-verification`: clean-context verdict, no editing.
8. `qta-delivery-finalization`: verified documentation and delivery state.

`qta-openclaw-integration` is a domain overlay and triggers only for explicit OpenClaw/QQ Agent API work.

Fixed ZCode roles live in `.zcode/agents/`. The implementer cannot accept its own work; the reviewer cannot
edit it; the final verifier can run gates but cannot repair code. No role may create nested subagents.

See `docs/ai/SKILL_AND_AGENT_GOVERNANCE.md` for the durable boundary and maintenance rules.

## 7. Checkpoint And Finalization

For in-progress, interrupted, blocked, or self-checked work, use `qta-task-checkpoint` and write only
task-local state under `docs/development/tasks/` plus an optional short-lived continuation handoff.

Before independent acceptance:

- Do not append `docs/development/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
- Do not append `docs/acceptance/ACCEPTANCE_LOG.md`.
- Do not update `docs/AI_HANDOFF.md` or `docs/BUILD_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Do not mark a capability verified, complete, or deployed.

After `ACCEPTED` or delivery-permitted `CONDITIONALLY_ACCEPTED`, use `qta-delivery-finalization` to update
only the project-level documents whose authoritative facts changed. Do not append long chat transcripts.

## 8. Completion Summary

Every final response should include:

- What changed.
- What was verified.
- What remains.
- Which handoff or docs were updated.

If the task stops midway, still write:

- Current git status.
- Modified files.
- Last successful command.
- Last failing command and error.
- Exact next command/prompt to resume.

Use `qta-task-checkpoint` for interrupted work. A checkpoint is not an acceptance record.
